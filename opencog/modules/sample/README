An example of how to make a module that is loadable into the CogServer with
the dlopen command. e.g.,

../CogServer/cogServer &
[2008-05-28 11:32:18:118] [INFO] opencog server ready.
telnet localhost 17001
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
opencog> dlopen libSampleModule.so
hello world
ok

Now that the module is loaded you can do:

opencog> hello
hello world
opencog>

This is an example of an "external command".. when the CommandRequestProcessor cannot find the "hello" command internally it looks for a function called "cmd_hello" in every loaded module.  The first to be found will be called with the queue of arguments from the command line (in this case none).
