                       Overview
                       --------

The CogServer provides a simple server interface to the reasoning system.

See CommandRequestProcessor.cc as an example control interface to
the server.  This command processor understands 3 simple commands:
load <xml file name>, ls and shutdown. There is an example XML file
under test/CogServer/atomSpace.xml

To run a simple test, build everything and execute 
bin/src/CogServer/cogServer.  From another terminal, run 
"telnet localhost 17001". Try loading the example XML file and ls 
to see all the nodes and links.


ToDo/Bugs:
----------
There is curently no job scheduling whatsoever, and no standardized
input-queue polling. Thus, all routines that look for input need to
poll, yet they also must minimize cpu overhead, to avoid blocking 
the command-line processor.   Heavy cpu use must be done in its
own threads.

This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, and should be fixed.
