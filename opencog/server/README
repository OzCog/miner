                       Overview
                       --------

The CogServer provides a simple network sehll server interface to the 
various functions in the opencog system.

To acess the shell server, build everything and execute 
bin/src/CogServer/cogServer.  From another terminal, run 
"telnet localhost 17001"; this will connect to the shell.
Alternately, "netcat localhost 17001" can be used. Long or
complex sequences of commands may be loaded by saying
"cat somefile | telnet localhost 17001" 

The main command dispatcher is implemented in CommandRequestProcessor.cc
This command dispatcher understands various commands, such as loading
data from XML files, loading and saving to SQL.  Type "help" at the
shell prompt to get a listing of the commands.

The server also includes a full scheme (guile) interpreter, 
allowing generic scripting to be done. See the README in the
src/guile directory for more info, and src/scm for various 
scriptlets.


ToDo/Bugs:
----------
* There is curently no job scheduling whatsoever, and no standardized
  input-queue polling. Thus, all routines that look for input need to
  poll, yet they also must minimize cpu overhead, to avoid blocking 
  the command-line processor.   Heavy cpu use must be done in its
  own threads.

* The load-file.c will load a scheme file on startup; however, the
  way it uses file paths is unsatisfactory.  This needs to be fixed.

* Need to document how module loading actually works.
