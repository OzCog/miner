Notes:
Skolemization (conversion of premises with variables to be encompassed by a
ForAll quantifier) is requred of axioms. Results of inference currently don't
create atoms with a form that requires for Skolemization but when it does, this
process should be automated.

== TODO

There are a lot of potential design changes that it'd be nice to make, as well
as other quite important tasks.

=== Important

* Changing the name of AtomTableWrapper to AtomSpaceWrapper
* Fresh = true bug. This is mostly done through the alteration of the
AtomTableWrapper. The tests still have to be validated and made to run though.
* Make PLN a loadable module
* Register PLN atoms types with the new ClassServer on module load
* Merge PLN shell requests into the CogServer Request processor.

=== Moderate

* Allow PLN to use general OpenCog XML loader instead of it's own special one.
Either by modifying the OpenCog loader or by adapting how PLN saves XML and
loads XML.

=== Nice to have
