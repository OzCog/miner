== TODO

There are a lot of potential design changes that it'd be nice to make, as well
as other quite important tasks.

=== Important

* Fresh = true bug.
* Integrate PLN atoms types with the rest of opencog in atomspace/types
* Changing the name of AtomTableWrapper to AtomSpaceWrapper

=== Moderate

* Allow PLN to use general OpenCog XML loader instead of it's own special one.
Either by modifying the OpenCog loader or by adapting how PLN saves XML and
loads XML.


=== Nice to have
