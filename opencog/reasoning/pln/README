== TODO

There are a lot of potential design changes that it'd be nice to make, as well
as other quite important tasks.

=== Important

* Fresh = true bug.
* Integrate PLN atoms types with the rest of opencog in atomspace/types
* Ask about changing the name of AtomTableWrapper to AtomSpaceWrapper
* Replace CogServer::getAtomSpace with a call to AtomTableWrapper::getAtomSpace,
    also implement a way to set the AtomSpace. Perhaps this is provided by the
    Pseudocore? investigate...



=== Moderate

* Allow PLN to use general OpenCog XML loader instead of it's own special one.
Either by modifying the OpenCog loader or by adapting how PLN saves XML and
loads XML.


=== Nice to have
