DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scripts to extract MOSES out of OpenCog project, and replace GPL
license by Apache (MOSES has double licensing).

Extraction
----------

To extract MOSES from OpenCog use the script OC2MOSES.sh. The usage is

   ./OC2MOSES.sh MOSES_DIR

MOSES_DIR is the name of the directory to create and place the MOSES
project.  Non-standard locations of the OpenCog project can be dealt
with by hacking the OC_PATH setting in the shell script.

For example,

    $ ./OC2MOSES.sh moses-3.0.9

It will create a directory moses-3.0.9 with a standalone version of
MOSES in it.

Installation
------------

Enter that directory for the next steps to compile and install MOSES
are

$ cd moses-3.0.9

To compile, from the root directory of MOSES:

$ mkdir bin
$ cd bin
$ cmake ..
$ make

Install (may required root privilege)

# make install
# ldconfig
