                          -------

OpenCog is a general-purpose reasoning system.
It currently consists of only the barest of essentials.

Prerequisites:
--------------
To build and run OpenCog, the following pacakges are required:
cmake -- a build management tool -- http://www.cmake.org/
cxxtest -- a test framework -- http://cxxtest.sourceforge.net/

To build opencog:
-----------------
cd to project root dir
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make

libs will be built into each src subdirectory.

Unit tests:
-----------
To run unit tests type (from the bin directory):

../scripts/run_utests.sh


Modifying the list of basic types
---------------------------------
At this time, the types are hard-coded (this should be fixed someday).
To build a new set of types, cd to src/AtomSpace, edit type.script
and then say "make", in that directory.  The makefile there will 
automatically build the new header files that define the types.


ToDo
----
Get cmake to automatically search for and detect cxxtest
(and complain when its missing)
