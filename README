                          OpenCog
                          -------

OpenCog is a general-purpose reasoning system.
It currently consists of only the barest of essentials.

Prerequisites:
--------------
To build and run OpenCog, the following pacakges are required:
cmake       -- a build management tool -- http://www.cmake.org/
cxxtest     -- a test framework -- http://cxxtest.sourceforge.net/

expat       -- an XML parsing library - 
               http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html (version 1.2)
               Debian/Ubuntu package libxmltok1-dev (supplies expat v1.2)
               Version 2 seems to work as well.  http://expat.sourceforge.net/

C++ Sockets -- a cross-platform C++ TCP/IP sockets wrapper 
               http://www.alhem.net/Sockets/

openssl     -- SSL sockets library 
               Debian/Ubuntu package libssl-dev

iodbc       -- http://www.iodbc.org/
               Debian/Ubuntu packages iodbc-dev or unixodbc-dev

To build opencog:
-----------------
cd to project root dir
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make

libs will be built into each src subdirectory.

Unit tests:
-----------
To build and run the unit tests, from the bin directory enter (after building
opencog as bellow): 

make test

Running the server:
-------------------
The CogServer provides a simple server interface to the reasoning
system.

See CommandRequestProcessor.cc as an example control interface to
the server.  This command processor understands 3 simple commands:
load <xml file name>, ls and shutdown. There is an example XML file
under test/CogServer/atomSpace.xml

To run a simple test, build everything and execute
bin/src/CogServer/cogServer.  From another terminal, run
"telnet localhost 17001". Try loading the example XML file and ls
to see all the nodes and links.


Scheme shell
------------
The cog server also includes a built-in scheme shell. The shell can be
started by typing "scm" after entering the opencog server shell. It can
be exited by placing a single . on a line by itself.  Documentation for
the available opencog commands can be found in src/guile/README.


Modifying the list of basic types
---------------------------------
At this time, the types are hard-coded (this should be fixed someday).
To build a new set of types, cd to src/AtomSpace, edit type.script
and then say "make", in that directory.  The makefile there will 
automatically build the new header files that define the types.


ToDo
----
Get cmake to automatically search for and detect cxxtest
(and complain when its missing)
